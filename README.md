Code from investigating/answering StackOverflow questions.

Most of these are intended to be run and built with [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb)'s [quick development commands](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/next/docs/guides/QuickDevelopment.md#quick-development-with-nwb), e.g. for React answers:

```sh
# Start a development server and auto-install dependencies
nwb react run index.js --install

# Create a build to share a working version (deployed via surge.sh or similar)
nwb react build index.js --title="Whatever"
```
